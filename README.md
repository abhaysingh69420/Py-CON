# Py-CON

With so much content coming out online daily, it can be time consuming to go to multiple sites and sources to consume information about your favorite subjects. Therefore content aggregators are so popular and powerful, as you can use them to view all the latest news and content in one place.
What is Content Aggregation, Anyway?
Content aggregator websites are sites that don‚Äôt produce their own original content. Instead, they collect content from other websites around the Internet and ‚Äúaggregate‚Äù it into one easy-to-find location.


 Py-CON is all in one content aggregator which connects different sites at one place within reach of fingerprints.
